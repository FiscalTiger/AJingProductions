What did you change/enhance from part 1?

    I made my about section more interesting by adding two parallax affects and organizing the content
    more.  I added a checklist of skills I have to make it look more professional.  Lastly, I added a
    call to the xkcd api that pulls their latest comic.  I think my website looks a lot more interesting
    and fun to look at than its previous version.

If there was a third part to the class project, what would you like to implement?

    I would spend most of my time on making the content better and putting more into the graphics.
    Since the site is just a portfolio site, there isn't than many technological advancements to be
    made, but I definitely can continue to add content that represents the kind of person I am.

What did you learn between part 1 and part 2?

    How to make an AJAX request and Jquery.  These to things have made my web skills way more versatile,
    and I feel as if I can actually call myself a web programmer.  Because of this website, I actually got
    an interview for a web developer internship and I am still in the process of interviewing for them.

What did you like about this project? How could it have been better?

    I like the freedom that you gave to make whatever we wanted, that way you got what you wanted out of the project
    rather than just doing a chore.  I would however liked for there to be more of a sprint like deadline system.
    This way you can get constant feedback from you or the TA as you slowly implement features rather than just two
    large submissions.

Thanks for the great semester and best of luck,
Andrew Pouleson
